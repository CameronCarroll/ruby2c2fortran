Ruby2C2Fortran
===============

A proof-of-concept project which accompanies the [codeblog writeup](http://ckcarroll.herokuapp.com/ruby2c2fortran)
Uses C as a middleman, allowing us to consume a Fortran function from Ruby.

Idea originally from a mailing list post from 2006. (Credit to Ron M; http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/78239#126917)
Original writeup and code written in July 2012.
Updated and rewritten in May 2014
